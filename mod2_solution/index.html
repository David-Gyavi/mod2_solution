  	<p id="Chicken">Chicking stands for food innovation. Following the introduction of the Mexita range of wraps and sandwiches, the Tandoori Bites and Flaming Grilled Chicken, Pizzas, Pasta were also launched. This was an immediate success. Chicking always serves an exciting and varied menu and draws inspiration from all kinds of taste cultures from around the world. From authentic American, mouth-watering Mexican, inspiring Indian, irresistible Italian to mouth-watering Filipino.

  	<p class="Beef">When you talk about enjoying meat, you are quickly talking about the barbecue. And not about the kind where you burn satays over an excessively hot fire, but about barbecuing as a cooking technique. Use your barbecue as a grill, oven or smoker and you can make everything you bought ready-made yourself. A hamburger or a steak is a piece of cake, in terms of preparation, and for a roast such as a picanha you don't turn around. We are happy to help you on your way to becoming a real barbecue enthusiast.
